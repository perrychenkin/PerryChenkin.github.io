                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio.</p><br>
                    <p>I attended audio engineering school and have been working in acoustics and audio installations for almost 10 years. While looking for a new direction, I found data analysis. With my years of watching sports, playing fantasy sports, and investing, I felt like it might be up my alley. After some research, I decided this would be the path for me.</p><br>
                    <p>
                        I began by using free resources to teach myself beginner HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Once I had a handle on those, and coding in general, I worked my way up to learn the basics of SQL and Python. When I was confident in my skills, I began online courses. I completed the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate on Coursera, as well as many other courses on CodeCademy. I have also earned the Entry-Level Python Programmer PCEP certification from Python Institute.

                        I have since been gaining real world experience helping an old employer by writing SQL reports for them. I use Microsoft Report Builder to query their case management software with SQL, then create tables and charts. I have also been doing various independent projects using online datasets and even building this website. Not only to have work to show potential employers, but also to continue honing my craft. 
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        I hope this page and my work demonstrate the kind of strong asset I could prove to be for any company.
